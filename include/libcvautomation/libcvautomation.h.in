 * \section intro Introduction
 * Welcome to Libcvautomation!
 * Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement for <a href="http://sikuli.org">Sikuli</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xpresser">Xpresser</a>. I was having incredible difficulty getting either of these solutions to work - Sikuli would crash whenever I tried to take a screenshot, and Xpresser was both too new for our Prominent North American Enterprise Linux systems, but also didn't work or \c import correctly. I really liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply didn't work. Additionally, I wanted to create a simple solution - it does what you want it to, and that's it.
 * \section how_it_works How Libcvautomation Works
 * Libcvautomation represents two software products coming together - <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a> and the <a href="http://www.x.org/docs/Xext/xtest.pdf">XTest extension</a> to the X11 server. OpenCV is used for image recognition, and XTest is used to actually drive the X server. You can dig into \ref libcvautomation-xtest.h to get an idea of what all this library is capable of. <br>
 * Basically what happens is that for whenever you need to do image recognition, OpenCV is used to find the images, and XTest is used to generate any events needed. Libcvautomation is mostly a wrapper to integrate both of these products, but also adds some functions like matchSubImage_X11() that allow you to match an image against the X11 root window in place. This means no more <tt>'xwd | convert "<out_name>"'</tt>.
 * \section main_installing Installing Libcvautomation
 * Installing Libcvautomation is easy. You can either manually install packages, add the Libcvautomation repository, or install from tarball (the first option is recommended).
 * \subsection main_rpm Install Libcvautomation RPM Repository
 * If you want to make sure that you're using the latest (stable) version of Libcvautomation, you can add the Libcvautomation repository to yum.
 * First, a new configuration file for the Libcvautomation repository:
 * \code sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/libcvautomation.repo \endcode
 * After you have the file open, put the following content in it:
 * \code [libcvautomation]
 * name=Libcvautomation RPM repository
 * baseurl=http://djbushido.github.com/libcvautomation/rpm
 * enabled=1
 * gpgcheck=0 \endcode
 * And once this is done, clean out the cache, and you should be good to go!
 * \code sudo yum clean all \endcode
 * Finally, if you want to begin developing application tests, you will need the following packages: \c libcvautomation, and \c libcvautomation-examples.
 * \subsection main_apt Install Libcvautomation APT Repository
 * If you want to make sure that you're using the latest (stable) version of Libcvautomation, you can add the Libcvautomation repository to APT.
 * First, open up your \c sources.list
 * \code sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list \endcode
 * Add the following content at the end:
 * \code #Libcvautomation Repository
 * deb http://djbushido.github.com/libcvautomation/apt libcvautomation/
 * deb-src http://djbushido.github.com/libcvautomation/apt libcvautomation-source/ \endcode
 * Run an update to make sure your packages refresh, and then you should be good to go!
 * \code sudo apt-get update \endcode
 * Finally, if you want to begin developing application tests, you will need the following packages: \c libcvautomation-dev, and \c libcvautomation-examples.
 * \subsection main_download Manual Download Packages
 * If you want to manually download the packages, see the Github downloads page for libcvautomation: <a href="https://github.com/DjBushido/libcvautomation/downloads">https://github.com/DjBushido/libcvautomation/downloads</a>
 * \subsection main_tarball Manual Tarball Installation
 * If you want to install Libcvautomation via tarball, you can do that too. Download a release tarball from the Downloads page on Github: <a href="https://github.com/DjBushido/libcvautomation/downloads">https://github.com/DjBushido/libcvautomation/downloads</a>
 * The source itself uses autotools, so it's incredibly easy to work with:
 * \code cd <location_of_tarball>
 * tar xf <tarball_file>
 * cd libcvautomation-<release_number>
 * ./configure
 * make
 * sudo make install \endcode
 *
 * \section main_using Using Libcvautomation And Writing Application Tests
 * So how does one go about using libcvautomation? <br>
 * I'm so glad you asked! I've provided a few reference programs - \c cva-match and \c cva-input - that can be used to demonstrate most of libcvautomation's capabilities. I've even provided a BASH wrapper to make it incredibly easy to use BASH with libcvautomation as well (requires that \c cva-match and \c cva-input are installed). Python bindings are on their way too. <br>
 * Finally, if you want to know how to write your own application tests, please see \ref writing_app_tests for more information on that. I've provided code to give you a basic idea of how they work.
 * \section questions Questions? Comments? Concerns?
 * Please send any feedback to <<a href="mailto:bspeice@uncc.edu">bspeice@uncc.edu</a>>. Pull requests can be submitted to <a href="https://github.com/DjBushido/libcvautomation">my github repository</a>.*/

/** \page writing_app_tests Writing Application Tests
 * \author Bradlee Speice <<a href="mailto:bspeice@uncc.edu">bspeice@uncc.edu</a>>
 * \date 7/23/2012
 * \section audience Audience
 * <ul>
 * <li>This document was written for people with some intermediate knowledge of BASH.
 * <li>Screenshot experience is required - being able to create screenshots of windows using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, the \c import command from <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, or something similar. <br>
 * <li>Required for working with libcvautomation internals (not needed strictly for writing application testing):
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>Intermediate-level C knowledge required for interfacing with libcvautomation. There isn't much complicated going on with libcvautomation itself, but you need to know to use cvaOpenDisplay() for grabbing a display and then cvaCloseDisplay() for closing it later for example.
 * 		<li>C++ is available, but currently only as <tt>extern "C"</tt> style bindings.
 * 		<li>Python bindings are in progress as of time-of-writing
 * 		</ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section purpose Purpose
 * <ul>
 * <li>This document is intended to outline the libcvautomation testing library for GUI applications and its two reference programs \c cva-match and \c cva-input
 * <li>These programs allow you to automate mouse and keyboard events in response to what appears on screen - for example, clicking a button based on an image of that button on screen.
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section using Using Libcvautomation
 * <ul>
 * <li>Since libcvautomation is a shared-object library intended to bundle a lot of functionality in one area, we must use external programs to agin access to the functions of libcvautomation.
 * <li>Two reference programs have been included to make this easy - \c cva-match and \c cva-input
 * <li>The reference programs are fairly full-featured, and expose most of libcvautomation:
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>\c cva-match allows you to match multiple image files against a root image providing very fine control over how specific the match is
 * 		<li>\c cva-input allows you to drive the X11 server using the XTest extension - for example, clicking on a button from image, clicking a key on the keyboard, and more.
 * 		</ul>
 * <li>These two programs should implement all functionality needed for GUI automation. Please contact <a href="mailto:bspeice@uncc.edu">bspeice@uncc.edu</a> if you have suggestions for extra functionality, patches, comments, etc.
 * <li>Finally, if you want to write your own programs using libcvautomation, the headers are located on your system. Use:
 * \code #include <libcvautomation/libcvautomation.h> \endcode
 * to include all necessary header files. See the "Files" tab above to get an idea of what functionality exists.
 * \note Intermediate C or C++ knowledge is required for programming with libcvautomation. C++ is currently only supported through <tt>extern "C"</tt>, and full C++ bindings are not currently planned. Libcvautomation itself is incredibly simple, but interfaces with a few API's (Xlib, libcv) that it is helpful to have an idea of how to use.
 *
 * \section testing Application Testing
 * Now we get into the good stuff. The basic process for application testing is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a sequence of screenshots for all mouse-clicks
 * <li>Create a testing wrapper in BASH for automating the application
 * <li>Test the wrapper and tune any necessary options
 * </ul>
 * \subsection screenshot_sequence Creating the Screenshot Sequence
 * <ul>
 * <li>This process creates a set of screenshots by which libcvautomation can drive the X11 server
 * <li>The process is simple - create a screenshot of all buttons you would like to click in an application test, or location where you would like to move the mouse, etc.
 * <li>This can be accomplished a number of different ways - using GIMP, the \c import command, or any other screenshot program. Additionally, libcvautomation will support any image format that OpenCV does. At the time of writing, these are:
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>Windows bitmaps - <tt>*.bmp</tt>, <tt>*.dib</tt>
 * 		<li>JPEG files - <tt>*.jpeg</tt>, <tt>*.jpg</tt>, <tt>*.jpe</tt>
 * 		<li>JPEG 2000 files - <tt>*.jp2</tt>
 * 		<li>Portable Network Graphics - <tt>*.png</tt>
 * 		<li>Portable image format - <tt>*.pbm</tt>, <tt>*.pgm</tt>, <tt>*.ppm</tt>
 * 		<li>Sun rasters - <tt>*.sr</tt>, <tt>*.ras</tt>
 * 		<li>TIFF files - <tt>*.tiff</tt>, <tt>*.tif</tt>
 * 		</ul>
 * <br>
 * <li>Some tips on creating screenshots:
 *		<ul>
 *		<li>Use as distinct an image as possible in a screenshot. For example, the following images look very similar, but can do very different things:
 *	 	\image html print-printbutton1.png 
 *	 	<br>
 *	 	\image html print-helpbutton.png
 *		<ul>
 *			<li>The large amount of grey-space in each of the images can be very confusing. While the text itself is different, the overwhelming amount of grey space can result in a false positive. Limiting the space of the screenshot can be useful:
 *			\image html print-printbutton2.png
 *			<br>
 *			\image html print-helpbutton.png
 *			<li>Limiting the button size in this case helps the program identify what button you want to click, but in general you want to include as much detail as possible.
 *		</ul>
 *		<br>
 *		<li>Be careful of where an image may appear multiple times in a screenshot. For example, a "Help" button on a dialog may get confused with the "Help" menu at the top of the screen.
 * </ul>
 *
 * \subsection testing_wrapper Create a Testing Wrapper
 * <ul>
 * <li>This is where the BASH knowledge comes into play. We are going to write a script that will run your application test, to make sure that the GUI is functioning correctly.
 * <li>The following is the (strongly) recommended process, but is not strictly necessary to follow this. The way I'm going to explain this is by giving an example test I wrote, and explain what is going on:
 * \code
 * #!/bin/bash
 * #This is an application test involving libcvautomation and libreoffice
 * . /etc/libcvautomation_funcs
 * set -o errexit
 *
 * #Changing any wrapper parameters should go here
 *
 *
 * start_libreoffice_writer ()
 * {
 *	click_i "screens/gnome-1_menu.png" "screens/kde-1_menu.png"
 *	click_i "screens/gnome-2_officeMenu.png" "screens/kde-2_officeMenu.png"
 *	hover_i "screens/gnome-3_LibreOfficeWriter.png" "screens/kde-3_LibreOfficeWriter.png"
 *	jiggle_mouse
 *	click
 *	sleep 30
 * }
 *
 * close_libreoffice_writer()
 * {
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-4_fileMenu.png" "screens/kde-4_fileMenu.png"
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-5_fileExit.png" "screens/kde-5_fileExit.png"
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-6_discard.png" "screens/kde-6_discard.png"
 * }
 *
 * start_libreoffice_writer
 * close_libreoffice_writer
 * \endcode
 * <br>
 * \code
 * #!/bin/bash
 * #This is an application test involving libcvautomation and libreoffice
 * . /etc/libcvautomation_funcs
 * set -o errexit
 *
 * #Changing any wrapper parameters should go here
 * \endcode
 * <li>The purpose of these lines is just the standard BASH header. Additionally, we import a wrapper created for libcvautomation to make our job easier. Please note that this is the default directory for the wrapper, your installation may be different. Use the command <tt>locate libcvautomation_funcs</tt> to find it on your computer. The wrapper itself is a handful of macros used to make our job easy.
 * <li>The \c set line will abort the test if an error is ever encountered - for example, no images are found.
 * <li>Changing any wrapper parameters should go after sourcing the wrapper functions. See \ref appendix_variables for more information.
 * <br><br>
 * \code
 * start_libreoffice_writer ()
 * {
 *	click_i "screens/gnome-1_menu.png" "screens/kde-1_menu.png"
 *	click_i "screens/gnome-2_officeMenu.png" "screens/kde-2_officeMenu.png"
 *	hover_i "screens/gnome-3_LibreOfficeWriter.png" "screens/kde-3_LibreOfficeWriter.png"
 *	jiggle_mouse
 *	click
 *	sleep 30
 * }
 * \endcode
 * <li>This is the actual body of work done by libcvautomation
 * <li>\c click_i is a function to click the mouse at an image - in this case, the gnome or kde menu.
 * 		<ul>
 *		<li>Because of how the cva-input program is designed, you can give it multiple images, and it will only select the one currently available. See the \ref wrapper_functions for more information on how to use this (\c TOLERANCE specifically)
 *		<li>Additionally, the wrapper (by default) will wait for an image to appear before clicking on it. This way, you can string together click_i commands even when the program may need to wait a while on processing. Make sure to read up on the \c TIMEOUT option to learn how to use this.
 * 		<li>By using the function \c click_i, we make things a bit more readable - the full command line is <tt>cva-input -s 'icmouseclick <filename>'</tt>
 * 		<li>See the \ref wrapper_functions for a list of all functions available in the wrapper.
 * 		</ul>
 * <li>\c hover_i is a function to move the mouse to an image - in this case, move it over the LibreOffice menu item.
 * <li>Then we jiggle the mouse to make sure that the item activates, click, and wait for the program to start up.
 * <br><br>
 * \code
 * close_libreoffice_writer()
 * {
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-4_fileMenu.png" "screens/kde-4_fileMenu.png"
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-5_fileExit.png" "screens/kde-5_fileExit.png"
 * 	click_i "screens/gnome-6_discard.png" "screens/kde-6_discard.png"
 * }
 * \endcode
 * <li>Use the \c click_i function to close down LibreOffice writer - Find the "File" menu, click "Exit", and then make sure to discard all changes.
 * <br><br>
 * \code
 * start_libreoffice_writer
 * close_libreoffice_writer
 * \endcode
 * <li>Actually run the functions given.
 * <br><br>
 * <li>Please note that this is a fairly trivial example. The full list of commands available in the wrapper is given in \ref wrapper_functions
 * </ul>
 *
 * \subsection testing_test_wrapper Testing the Testing Wrapper
 * <ul>
 * <li>First things first, run through the testing wrapper to make sure that everything is O.K.
 * <li>If you need to, there are a few environment variables you can set to change how the wrapper works. See \ref appendix_variables for more information on how these work.
 *	<li>A full list of commands provided by the wrapper is available at \ref appendix_functions
 *	</ul>
 *
 * \note These options are controlled using the testing script as demonstrated above. Any modifications to the following values should be done at the line: \code #Changing any wrapper parameters should go here \endcode
 * </ul>
 * \section wrapping_up Wrapping Up
 * <ul>
 * <li>At this point you should have all the information you need to write your own application tests. The libcvautomation library and reference programs were designed to be simple and powerful, but if you invest the time to learn them and some expert BASH scripting, you can do some very complex things. 
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>For example, integrating a <a href="http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Tap-functions">Test Anything Protocol</a> wrapper into your scripts as well.
 * 		</ul>
 * <li>If you have questions, comments, concerns, suggestions, or feedback in general, feel free to let me know at <a href="mailto:bspeice@uncc.edu">bspeice@uncc.edu</a>.

/** \page wrapper_functions Appendix of Wrapper Functions and Environment Variables
 * \section appendix_variables Environment Variables
 * \subsection appendix_search Search Method
 * \code SEARCH_METHOD \endcode
 * This controls how each of the functions searches for an image. See \ref libcvautomation_search_methods for more instruction on how to use this option.
 *
 * \subsection appendix_tolerance Tolerance
 * \code TOLERANCE
 * USE_SANE_TOLERANCE \endcode
 * These control how tolerant each function is when searching for an image. Acceptable values are anywhere between \c INT_MIN to \c INT_MAX. See \ref libcvautomation_search_methods for more information on how the tolerance values work.
 * Additionally, the cva-input and cva-match programs (which this wrapper depends on) implement a "sane-tolerance" option. This allows you to set a tolerance between 1 - 100, where: \f$ 1 \approx 0 \f$, and \f$ 100 \approx INT\_MAX \f$
 * By default, functions will not use sane tolerance. To make the functions search using sane tolerance, set \code USE_SANE_TOLERANCE="yes" \endcode
 *
 * \subsection appendix_center Center
 * \code USE_CENTER \endcode
 * This controls whether each function will return a value based on the center of the sub-image, rather than the top-left corner.
 * By default, functions will use center-based matching. To make the functions use the top-left corner, set \code USE_CENTER="" \endcode
 *
 * \subsection appendix_wait Wait
 * \code USE_WAIT
 * TIMEOUT \endcode
 * These control how the "waitfor" function is used. By default, all image-matching functions will wait for an image to appear, and then click on it. This way, it won't click randomly if it can or can't find an image, and provides very easy error recognition. The functions will wait for a period of \c TIMEOUT seconds before complaining.
 * To disable waiting before performing an action, set \code USE_WAIT="" \endcode
 * \warning Without setting a tolerance value, the waitfor function becomes totally useless, as the first search will always find an image. <tt>Make sure to set the tolerance</tt> (or just leave it as the default value in the wrapper).
 *
 * \subsection appendix_output Output and Debugging
 * \code OUTFILE
 * ERRFILE \endcode
 * These files control the reporting of libcvautomation_funcs. The wrapper generates a decent amount of output to help in debugging application tests, and by default these get redirected to /dev/null. To instead redirect them to a file, you can do something like this:
 * \code OUTFILE=`mktemp`; echo "Logfile: " $OUTFILE
 * ERRFILE=`mktemp`; echo "Error file: " $ERR_FILE \endcode
 * This will redirect the output and error output to a file you own, and inform you of what that file is.
 *
 * \section appendix_functions Functions
