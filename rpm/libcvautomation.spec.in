%description
Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement for Sikuli and Xpresser. Each solution had large problems with crashing, and both refused to function on Red Hat Linux and Ubuntu 12.04. The author really liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply didn't work. As such, a simple library was designed to integrate OpenCV and XTest, which can be used by BASH to drive GUI testing and automation, and works on both new and old Linux distributions.
