%description
Libcvautomation is a GUI automation and testing tool based on image
recognition and response. This program was designed as a direct replacement
for Sikuli and Xpresser. Each solution had large problems with crashing, and
both refused to function on Red Hat Linux and Ubuntu 12.04. The author really
liked the way each of these programs approached GUI automation, but they simply
didn't work. As such, a simple library was designed to integrate OpenCV and
XTest, which can be used by BASH to drive GUI testing and automation, and works
on both new and old Linux distributions.
